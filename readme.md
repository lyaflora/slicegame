# Welcome to my game project!

This game has been originally made for a university project.
However, I plan to work on it and update it as frequently as possible.

## What kind of game is this?

This is a logical game, you know, where you have to think a bit.
There are currently only 6 demo levels, but more content is coming soon!

## How to launch

The game is currently only available on a Windows 64-bit OS.
To play the game, simply click on

`â¬‡ Code > Download ZIP`

After downloading, you should be able to unzip and start the Onlab.exe file.

Note: your antivirus might not like the project, it is possible that you need to disable it if you want to play. (No viruses I promise)

## Thank you for playing! Stay tuned for updates!
